## Questions? 游뱂
### How can I use this project?
**Note**: This is intended for personal use and should only be used on your own development server.
If you want to use this Rest API on your own - make sure you have PHP installed on your local PC along with a local server and a database. 
Set up your database and edit the `config/Database.php` file with your personal database credentials.
Note that your database tables must match the parameters in `classes/Course.php`, `classes/Website.php` and `classes/WorkExperience.php`.

You can also use this Rest API with an API testing tool such as ARC or Postman but note that you will need a valid token for some of the methods.

This web service is free to GET, but needs a valid token to POST, PUT or DELETE. 
There are several endpoints of this Rest API but they all use 3 database tables - courses, workexperiences and websites.
